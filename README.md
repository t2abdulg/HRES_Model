Dynamic Modelling of Hybrid (Wind-Fuel Cell) Renewable Energy Systems via MATLAB 
Author: Thouheed Abdul Gaffoor, MASc Student in Civil Engineering, University of Waterloo

The following package was developed to evaluate the dynamic energy output of a hybrid renewable energy microgrid system. 
The primary objective of this script is to evaluate the feasibility of any renewable microgrid system to function 
as a distributed energy source to offset some demand in an energy-intensive system. 
This may be applied to residential systems, commercial/school HVAC, or a pumping station (original design).

The current microgrid system includes:
1) a small wind-turbine (50 kW) but can be upsized as part of the script
2) Fuel cell system for energy storage

The analysis provided in this script includes:
1) Annual Energy Production of selected turbine
2) Hourly Energy Production and storage of microgrid
3) Net metering Financial Analysis of system

**ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**
- Evaluating other energy systems (i.e. photovoltaic, battery storage)
- Coupling with Hydraulic models for pumping stations, water distribution networks
- Evaluation microturbine (PAT technologies) for water distribution systems
